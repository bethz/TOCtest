    "# Building a Real-time Recommendation API\n",
    "\n",
    "This reference architecture shows the full lifecycle of building a recommendation system. It walks through the creation of appropriate azure resources, training a recommendation model using Azure Databricks and deploying it as an API. It uses Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure Kubernetes Service. \n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture can be generalized for many recommendation engine scenarios, including recommendations for products, movies, and news. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "![architecture](https://recodatasets.blob.core.windows.net/images/reco-arch.png \"Architecture\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: A media organization wants to provide movie or video recommendations to its users. By providing personalized recommendations, the organization meets several business goals, including increased click-through rates, increased engagement on site, and higher user satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reference, we train and deploy a real-time recommender service API that can provide the top 10 movie recommendations for a given user. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "This architecture consists of the following key components:\n",
    "* [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks) is used as a development environment to prepare input data and train the recommender model on a Spark cluster. Azure Databricks also provides an interactive workspace to run and collaborate on notebooks for any data processing or machine learning tasks. \n",
    "* [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)(AKS) is used to deploy and operationalize a machine learning model service API on a Kubernetes cluster. AKS hosts the containerized model, providing scalability that meets throughput requirements, identity and access management, and logging and health monitoring. \n",
    "* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a globally distributed database service used to store the top 10 recommended movies for each user. Azure Cosmos DB is ideal for this scenario as it provides low latency (10 ms at 99th percentile) to read the top recommended items for a given user. \n",
    "* [Azure Machine Learning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/) is a service used to track and manage machine learning models, and then package and deploy these models to a scalable Azure Kubernetes Service environment.\n",
